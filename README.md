## Usage Examples & API Documentation

### Code Examples

#### Bkash Payment Integration
The `BkashController` class handles the Bkash payment process.

```java
// Example usage of BkashController
BkashController bkashController = new BkashController();
// Implement methods to initiate, execute and verify Bkash transactions
```

// Example usage of BuyTicketController
BuyTicketController buyTicketController = new BuyTicketController();
// Implement methods for ticket purchase
```

### API Documentation (Placeholders)

This project uses JavaFX for its front-end, not a REST API.  If you were building a separate back-end API, this section would describe the endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.  Since it is JavaFX, you should review the JavaFX documentation for UI component properties and event handling.

## Configuration Options

The following configuration options are available:

*   **Bkash API Credentials:** Stored within the `BkashController.java` file. Ensure these are kept secure.
*   **Hotel API Credentials:** Stored within the `CoxhotelController.java` file. Ensure these are kept secure.
*   **CSS Styling:** The look and feel of the application can be modified by altering the `tab.css` file located in `Project/src/main/resources/com/example/project/`.  The colors, font sizes, and other styling features can be changed directly in this file.
